// Package modelgroups defines the shared attribute key and Cloneable type used
// to attach group membership to a Model in the datalayer. Producers (the
// model-config-datasource plugin) publish a model's group names here; consumers
// (the model-group-name-filter) read the same attribute to resolve "auto/<group>"
// selectors, so the storage contract has a single source of truth.
